# ROS 2 Simple Publisher-Subscriber Project

This is a basic ROS 2 project that demonstrates the implementation of a simple publisher and subscriber. The publisher sends messages, and the subscriber receives and processes these messages. This project is a great starting point for understanding the basics of ROS 2 communication between nodes.

## Project Structure

- **Publisher Node**: Sends out messages at regular intervals.
- **Subscriber Node**: Listens for incoming messages and processes them.
